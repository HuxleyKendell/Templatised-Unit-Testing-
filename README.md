Hey there, welcome to the guide for implementing Database DevOps and unit testing with Redgate and Azure DevOps! I'm Huxley Kendell, a Solutions Specialist at Redgate, and I'm excited to help you streamline your database development and deployment processes. You can also find more insights and resources on my blog at [HuxleyKendell.com](https://www.huxleykendell.com).

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, here's what you'll need:

1. **Flyway Enterprise Trial**: To request a trial of Redgate's Flyway Enterprise, please reach out to Redgate directly by visiting [Flyway Enterprise Trial](https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/enterprise/trial/). Here you can get the needed trial and any assistance.
2. **Basic Understanding of Flyway**: Familiarise yourself with the basic concepts and usage of Flyway. Check out the [Getting Started](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/getstarted/) guide to quickly get up to speed.
3. **Azure DevOps Account**: Sign up for an account at [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com/) if you don't already have one.
4. **Azure DevOps Agent Configuration**: Make sure you have an Azure DevOps agent configured to execute your CI/CD pipelines. If you need assistance with agent configuration, I'm here to help.

> **Note:** Please remember that this is my personal code, and while I've put in my best efforts to make it valuable and reliable, it's important to use it with care and thoroughly test it before any production implementation. Both Redgate and I are here to support you throughout your Database DevOps journey.

## Why Unit Testing for Databases?

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and it's equally important for databases. By implementing unit tests for your databases, you can:

- Identify and fix issues early in the development process.
- Ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Validate database changes and prevent regressions.
- Increase confidence in deployments and reduce the risk of downtime.
- Facilitate collaboration between developers and DBAs.

For more information on unit testing databases and best practices, you can visit my blog at [HuxleyKendell.com](https://www.huxleykendell.com) or explore the extensive resources provided by Redgate.
